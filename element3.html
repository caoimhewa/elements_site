        <p>The app I decied to design is called Quirkey. Its purpose is to locate besoke boutiques in cities around the world. The design of the app is meant to exude dreamyness through the colour scheme and illustratin style. The idea behind this compliment the idea of going waay to knew cities adn unkown places to dicover- just like in your dreams. The pastels create a soft asttetic with feminine vibes.</p>
